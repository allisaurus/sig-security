# SIG Security Charter

## Overview of SIG
SIG Security is a special interest group for O3DE security. It serves as an advisory group for security related issues including compliance, security issue resolution, and security patching. The SIG is responsible for maintaining vulnerability reporting and response mechanisms for O3DE. In addition the SIG assists with other tasks that fall under the [Application Security (AppSec)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_security) umbrella of concern.

## Goals

- To be set after rest of the charter is reviewed.

## Scope
-  Gather information about security flaws. 
-  Identify potential security risks/gaps in Software.
-  Define best practices for ensuring secure code.

## In scope

- Triage and Acceptance of incoming security issues.
- Creation and maintenance of mechanisms for the secure intake of vulnerability issues, including any security reporting email lists for O3DE.
- Management of GitHub security advisories for the O3DE repros.
- Management of any security disclosure mechanisms including email lists.
- Assists in the selection or development of tooling and automation for security issue identification.
- Runs security campaigns to resolve identified security issues, including deprecation of software components.
- Provide SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange) scanning tools to detect violations.

## Cross-cutting Processes

- Disseminating information to other sigs for action / update/ fixing
- Review and provide feedback on SIG presented features and implementation
- Provide SPDX Licensing report violations to corresponding SIGs
- Advise SIGs on secure use of new libraries 
- Provide web and docs team with links to campaign information stored in SIG's repository
- Provide consultation for compliance automation scanning at periodic intervals and point release intervals for each potential issue and report violations to appropriate SIGs.
- Advise Technical steering committee and Governing board of potential threats and unresolved issues.
- Items that span or require other SIGs or groups and how it relates to this SIGâ€™s responsibilities

## Out of Scope
- Not responsible for fixing any detected or reported security issues.
- Not responsible for enforcing or acting upon any legal compliance issues.
